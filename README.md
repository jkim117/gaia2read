# gaia2read
C command line program to query the Gaia DR2

DataPreparation includes programs to prepare the Gaia DR2 source files (in csv.gz format) into an easily read binary format

gaialib2 contains the actual query program. Use Makefile to compile and create the executable program.

Note that I have not included the HAT and 2MASS ID query feature that was originally included in this program because the binary files are too large to include here.
